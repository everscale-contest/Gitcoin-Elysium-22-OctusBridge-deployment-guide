# OctusBridge deployment guide

Requirements: nodejs(16 is recommended), python, 


1. Clone repo: git clone **--recursive**
2. Follow steps in guides:
	1. Ethereum.md
	2. Everscale.md
	3. Ansible.md

Sorry, this guide and Ansible playbook is not completed. I am over today.
You can find proof of work in screenshots folder. I've done with frontend, relay and partical Everscale and Ethereum contracts deployment.
I deployed even DAO, staking and token, but stuck with Ethereum and events contracts deploying and configuring.
I can create tonos-cli ansible collection and complete all in one deployment solution later, but not this night.

Ansible playbook repo available at [Github](https://github.com/AntonIXO/octusbridge-ansible)
